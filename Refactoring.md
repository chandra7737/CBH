# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

In the refactored code, I made several changes to improve readability and maintainability:

- Extracted the constants: I introduced a separate constants module and used it to store the TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY and MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH constants. This separation helps to keep the main code cleaner and easier to understand.

- Simplified variable assignment: Instead of using nested if statements to assign the candidate variable, I used a single assignment statement with a logical OR (||) operator. This makes the code more concise and reduces nesting.

- Reordered and simplified conditionals: I rearranged the conditionals to follow a logical flow. First, I check if candidate is not a string and convert it to a JSON string if necessary. Then, I handle the case where candidate is falsy (null or undefined) and assign the TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY to it. This order makes the code easier to read and understand.

- Improved code formatting: I applied consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks to enhance readability.

These changes make the refactored code more readable by reducing unnecessary nesting, simplifying conditionals, and extracting constants to a separate module. The code follows a logical flow, making it easier to understand the purpose and functionality of each part.
